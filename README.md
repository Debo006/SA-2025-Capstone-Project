# 🚗 Dynamic Pricing for Urban Parking Lots

This capstone project implements **dynamic pricing** models using real-time streaming data for urban parking lots.
The goal is to optimize pricing based on demand indicators like occupancy, traffic, queue length, and special days.

## 📌 Models Implemented

### 📘 Model 1: Occupancy-Based Pricing

A simple rule-based model that adjusts price linearly with occupancy percentage.

### 📗 Model 2: Demand-Based Pricing

A more advanced model using multiple demand factors:

- Queue Length (normalized)
- Traffic Condition (scored)
- IsSpecialDay (binary)
- VehicleWeight (mapped from vehicle type)
- Occupancy / Capacity

### 💡 Demand Function

```
demand = 2 * (occupancy / capacity) + queue_norm + traffic_norm + is_special_day + vehicle_weight
price = 10 + 5 * norm_demand
```
